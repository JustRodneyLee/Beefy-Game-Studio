# Beefy Game Studio
A Game Editing Tool made for Windows written on top of the C# MonoGame Framework.

This tool was built for my previous game project (https://github.com/JustRodneyLee/Unknown-Snow-Grounds) due to its sluggish development progress. I'm trying to structure out a new engine based on my experiences from the last attempt. By including GUI for game dev, I could speed up my progress.

# Current Progress
The editor is now able to do basic level manipulation, including asset importing, object placement, rotation and scaling. More functions will be expected in the next few months (Level I/O, Code builder, Commentary system, probably a test running system?).

# Dependencies
This project requires the .NET 4.7 Framework and MonoGame.Forms to run. (https://github.com/sqrMin1/MonoGame.Forms).

# Cease of Development
Due to the lack of time and adequate knowledge, I have encountered too many obstacles trying to finish this editor. I couldn't wrap my head around asset management, and the engine was once again poorly structured and could not accomodate scripting (thus game logic does not exist) and the remaining workload was overwhelmingly big. This project and its related projects will be indefinitely suspended from development.
